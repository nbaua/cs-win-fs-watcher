# cs-win-fs-watcher
C# .Net Core File System Watcher With UI Thread Management

### Why?
Recently I built a online front-end and corresponding mobile app for a project which had many JSON test data files genrated.
I created a JSON merging utility which work like a charm.
However I  wanted to process few files exculsivly to be updated in certain way and genrate weired test data.
So this FS watcher came to rescue. Of course it does not contain the custom logic I needed for my project.
I just provides the barebones for you to get started.
